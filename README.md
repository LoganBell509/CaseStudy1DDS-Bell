Executive Summary:
I was tasked to make a prediction model on the attrition of employees at FritoLay, with an emphasis on having accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity all above 60%
Trends of job roles were also an important factor to be examined

Three factors found to impact the attrition the most (in combination):
1. Job Role
2. Number of Companies Worked
3. Overtime

Performance of Models:
First Model:

Accuracy - 72.80%

Sensitivity - 64.71%

Specificity - 74.01%

Second Model:

Accuracy - 83.03%

Sensitivity - 76.92%

Specificity - 83.85%

Third Model:

Accuracy - 85.32%

Sensitivity - 80.77%

Specificity - 85.94%

I was very surprised by how much Overtime impacted the attrition of employees, and how high the attrition rates were for the sales department.
